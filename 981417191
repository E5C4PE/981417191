Section II Training [Customer Service]

I. Turkish Airlines has high standards within its staff team. This must be achieved trough proper and good customer service.

II. If you are assigned the role of Customer Service during a flight, you must stand in areas around the airport such as check in around duty free and shops and around
the gate.

III. These are all key points in a passenger's journey and they must be places where they need the most help. 

IV. If a customer approaches you, ensure to be respectful and matuxre. Simply assist them in the best way possible.

IV.I. If they ask for where the gate or lounge is, simply bring them there with to their requested area of the airport.

IV.II. It is important to familiarise yourself with knowing where key locations are, such as lounges or gates so you know where to go when directing a customer. Doing Customer Service is pretty self explanatory and simple.

V. Whilst doing Customer Service, you may encounter a few problems. It is your responsibility to fix them yourself. There are many examples, but here are some examples.

V.I. Check-in not working for a customer: If check-in isn't working for a customer and they have attempted to check in multiple times, you should check them in manually.

V.II. Customer talking in another language: If the customer you are communicating with doesn't speak English, you will need to find a staff member that talks the language
that the customer is speaking or utilise google translate or any other translator.

V.III. UI stuck on customers screen: If a customer has a UI stuck on their screen, you will instruct them to head to one of the refreshing buttons found all around the airport.

Section II [Customer Service] Small Test.

Scenario I: A customer is currently trying to check-in, but the system isn't working. What would you do in this scenario?
Solution I: Manually check them in.

Scenario II: A customer is looking for Gate B1A at Istanbul Airport. They approach you and ask you where the gate is. What would you do?
Solution II: Guide them towards the gate.


Greeting: Very good everyone. We will now move onto personalisation. Having personalisation has a big effect on passengers. Your service and greetings are more catered and make them feel cared for and more specialised.
towards customers.

For example, instead of saying, Merhaba! Welcome onboard Turkish Airlines. We hope you have a pleasant flight! If you have any questions, please do let me know as I am always willing to help!

You must press `Z` before pressing `C` or `X`.

Jetway is used to take passengers from airport to plane or vice versa. We use **PROP** and **uJetway**. uJetway is very simple and uses buttons. PROP is the more advanced jetway using `WASD` for movement. `F&R` for tilting, `Q&E` for moving the cab and more commands that can be found in the controls menu on the jetway.

Lights are controlled by the button on the bottom left corner. Make sure you open Cab and Rotunda doors in the jetway.



# Phase II.III

## De-Icing Operations
- You should insert the truck in snowy/cold airports and enviroments, such as **Krakow**

- It is not expected to do a perfect job, but ensure that it is realistic as it is purely for realism and roleplay purposes.

- De-icing happens at the gate

## Fire Truck Operations

- Fire trucks are used for inaugural and emergency situations.

- There is a GUI to operate the hose, and to recieve the GUI, you should enter the right-most seat in the cab.

- In a inaugural situation, two trucks will be lined up opposite each other, and the top hose will be used to provide a water salute.

## Cobus Operations

- The *cobus* is always used in **Cluj-Napoca Airport**.

- When the bus is in its "anchored" phase, ensure to remain in the driver's seat, otherwise it may cause the bus to malfunction.

- Currently, the anchor button doesn't work as intended, so a temporary replacement is to use the `:freeze me` command to anchor.

- Make sure to come to a **complete** stop before disembarking PAX and anchoring!


II.III - Miscellaneous Vehicles

1. De-Icing truck, it is to be used in snowy and cold airports such as Krakow, with approval of the FM and when getting dismissed off a briefing. To operate it jump in and press the button on the far right side. Then click the button on the left to access controls, there are also slides to control the hose angle and the height depending on the aircraft that is having ice removed. You don't need to do it perfectly because it is for roleplay. 

2. Fire truck, The fire truck is only used for 2 things, 1 Inaugurals, 2. Emergencies. During emergencies position the fire truck near the other vehicles and once the plane has landed and stopped begin spraying the plane with water by using the GUI on the top left corner of the screen. To access the UG hop on the rightmost seat of the firetruck and try to only use the water settings, the fire truck is moved using WASD. 

3. Cobus, When you sit on the BUS you should see a GUI pop on the top right corner that says "Anchor" and "Jump Power". Keep in mind that when you see the warning symbol on the button it means it is on. Remember when Anchor is on that you can't jump off the bus, or else it will bug. When parked make sure the bus is at a complete stop before your freeze yourself, and turn off jumppower. Once passengers get in they won't be able to jump until you turn off the jumppower. Remember to drive in a nice fashion along the road lines and to not be unprofessional whilst driving the Cobus.
